"a2","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I am very pleased with the phone we received.  It is a genuine Samsung S3.  I purchased this for my wife, she took it to the ATT store where they plugged in a sim card and set it up within 5 minutes.  No problems at all.  It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system.  The price was in line with other sellers. Breed shipped the phone right away.I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers (even from the same seller).  However, I think that reviews may get bundled under specific product names so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for sale by the specific seller.  This ad was for a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone and that is exactly what we received."

"a4","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This TV has a great picture quality.  The picture is great.  The sound is awesome.  Eventhough it is very expansive for a TV but if you have the money, this is great TV to own.  If the lights are out and your watching a  movie on this TV it feels like you are at a movie theater."
"a5","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This is a great TV. Whenever I think of buying something that is technology related, I buy Sony. It is the only brand that I trust, and they have never failed me. This TV has great resolution, and provides great  sound. It has an easy to understand remote and a great picture as long as  it isn't coming from cable. If you are thinking of getting a big screen and  are currently a cable subscriber ask them if you will need a signal  booster.  Although if watching a video or DVD the picture is excellent,  clear as can be. Another thing is that it is light, which makes moving it  very easy.  Go for it!"
"a6","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","If you need to have a big TV to see all your favorite movies and TV programmes, this Sony Projection TV is ideal for you. The quality of image is superb, the sound is even more fantastic and functionality is the best I  have ever seen in my life. The proce/value is exceptional. Don't miss it!"
"a7","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I love it except that it is too big for my small New York appartment. Ideal if you have space."
"a8","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","i have owned this phone for more than 6 months now and well i have never had any complain of dropped calls, or poor signal reception. I find strong signals in areas where my previous samsung phone or motorola phona didnt have signals. the camera is okie nothing great, yet goodenough for camera wallpapers, but honestly you need a phone not a serious digital camera. The organization of menu and battery life is decent. Overall i love this phone, but wish it had infrared or bluetooth connectivity to my other devices."
"a9","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I went through about 5 phones within a 4 month period always some kind of problem. Until I upgraded to the Sanyo 8100 which Im shocked to have now had it for longer than a year. I could have sworn it would just had lasted me about 6 months. So I rate this Sprint phone with 5 stars and I plan on staying with it till it dies or just stay in the Sanyo family."
"a10","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","The 8100 is still a great little phone but it's been out for over a year here in the States.  Sprint just rolled out the newer VM4500 (aka, Sanyo 5500) super-phone, with video recording, VGA-resolution (640x480) digital camera, nation-wide walkie-talkie (!!!), and speakerphone, plus all the other bells and whistles.  Check it out.  If you want a free Sprint PCS phone, get the SCP-8100.  If you are willing to spend money, get the VM4500.BTW, to address the customer service complaint, I've been a Verizon Wireless customer for 6 years, a Sprint PCS customer for almost 4 years, and have also used T-Mobile/Voicestream and AT&T, and Cingular, and let me tell you Sprint has the best service by far.  Only one slight billing error in 4 years, and they corrected it right away after I called.  Verizon over-bills me almost every six months and takes forever to credit me back.  T-Mobile's coverage and service are complete jokes, their only \'virtue\' is payback-after-rebate dirt-cheap phones.  Sprint PCS also has the best voice clarity by far, Verizon is the worst even though they do have the widest CDMA coverage."
"a11","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I have had this phone for 3 years now, and i cannot tell you how many times I've dropped it, and it is still running fine. I don't know what that other person did to it to make it break after 6 months. My biggest complaint about it is that after 3 years of working great, the battery is starting to crap out on me, but other than that, the phone is great. (I wish I could say the same for sprint's service)."
"a12","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","forget all those other camera phones.one of the best phonessprint ever carried. trust me get the 8100 you won't be disappointed!!"
"a13","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Great phone!! To get the most out of this phone, you need to get the PCS Vision. I wasn't really impressed with the built in camera feature, but what can you expect? its a PHONE!! Another great feature about this phone is the ability to surf the web. You can visit almost any site with this! Overall, very lovely phone."
"a14","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Not for a single moment do I regret buying this phone. It is just AWESOME! The camera is cool, even with a bit little resolution. The menues are just perfect, incredible inside and outside display. Java, games, internet...oh my gosh, this phone really rocks! I am on Sprint now and regret the service a bit for its high prices but the phone definitely worths it. I am waiting for my rebate to come so it will be even sweater - FREE!"
"a15","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I love this phone. I've had my own for over a year now and have since bought one for my son and for my daughter. Battery life is excellent, more features that I could dream of using. The phone camera takes OK photos (don't even try at a concert... haha) - and the more modern phones do better in this department, but I'm very satisfied. Just be forewarned. With Sprint PCS, you will encounter many dropped calls and ignorant customer service staff. I've been with Sprint for 7 years now, so I know what I'm talking about. I'd switch, but we get a really good deal through our company. But I digress... the phone is great, I highly recommmend."
"a16","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Easy to use, easy to open one handed, more features than I had hoped for, very durable, and most importantly, great reception.  This phone kills the lg1010 I used previously.  The pictures are great for a phone, keeping in mind that it is a phone."
"a17","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I am a very satisfied 14 year old. I got this phone 2 weeks ago and I love it. It has so many things you can do with it...Screensavers,ringtones,games... I spent way too much money downloading those things but who cares... Sprint service is a little high though, $50.00 a month for 300 minutes plus PCS Vision. The camera is of higher quality than I thought it would be. Plus if you don't want to buy the PC link cable thing for $20.00 then you can be cheap and take pictures of your computer screen.lol.Overall a very good phone"
"a18","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Excellent Phone - Sprint tried to get me to get a new phone but this one was awesome. I loved that little phone, too bad Sprint was getting too costly for my mobile needs.Great durable phone (i actually have 2 of those)"
"a19","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I have had this phone for almost two years and it has now broken in half. This has been the best phone by far I have ever owned. I have dropped it a bizzilion times and all the features still worked. It has falling off a moving car, fell in my pool, been thrown into a moving car..  Nice tough phone.. Now I have to find a replacement...  Ugh....  I hope I can find another phone that can with stand the abuse and recklessness of the 8100."

"a22","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","i own this cell phone. this cell phone is really good for its price you could go online and download games, screensavers, and lot of other things also if you are a member of msn, aol, or yahoo you could log in and chat with ur friends and it has a lot of other features so, that's why i think this phone is really good."
"a23","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","The best phone ever dont waste your money .nokia,motorola or exetera thi is the phone you want to by folow my advice."
"a24","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I've been using Nokia and Samsung phones over 2 years. One day my buddy who works for Sprint told me to dump my phone. I thought Sprint and its phone were bad, but now I realize that I was totally wrong. This phone kicks Samsung's ass! Great reception, good camera, unlimited internet access, and lots of cool apps. Most excellent thing is that you can watch TV(w/extra fees) Overall this is one of the greatest wireless phone out there."
"a25","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This is a great phone, i have no problem with it. They keys are spaced, the ittle ball which is used for navigation is difficult at first however, it becomes easier until you get used to it. Bluetooth, infared are all extremmely easy ways for it and my computer to exchange info. The games are great, the music is loud. Reception is generally good compared to my other phones. its small and light, i would recomend it to anyone."
"a26","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This is a nice phone.Its small and compact, and filled with features.I like it a lot, but this web-site has it for a high price.You can find this phone free and for $50, if you look.I went to the att store in my mall, and they had it for $50.00"
"a27","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Excellent phone!  Very sleek, stylish and easy to use once you fiddle around for a couple of hours.  Has a plethora of options and is extremely customizable.  Digital camera is a great feature, and works very easily with special effects such as sephia, black & white, negative, and night mode.  Large display is vivid and clear.  Last but not least, the battery life is POWERFUL for such a little phone.  Only negatives I can conjure up is the fact that the keys sometimes get stuck, and also the phone does smudge easily, although very scratch-resistant.  I would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone with AT&T carrier."
"a28","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","First of all, this is a great cell phone.The best of its features is its amazing battery life.  It can be on for at least 3 days without the battery dying.  Secondly, the interfaceis very user friendly and everything is a click away.  The compact size of the phone also is a plus.  It easily fits in my pocket, but i still know its there.There's only two minor problems.  The first, which is VERY minor is that the surface is not very smudge proof.  The second of the minor problems is that sometimes reception is lacking, probably AT&T's fault, but it does happen.Overall, a great cell phone that would satisify anyone."
"a29","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I love this phone! I mean it's got tons of cool features... small.. battery doesn't drain like all my freinds... I get better reception better then all my friends that don't have this phone.... Bluetooth is rad too. Get this phone it's worth every penny"
"a30","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I got this phone because it has Bluetooth and is compatible with iSync (the Mac OSX synchronizing software.) I wanted to have my calendar on my phone - the rest was gravy. So I plugged in my Bluetooth adapter, clicked on one control panel, it saw my phone and added it. I opened iSync, it saw my phone, I clicked on \'Sync\' and in less than 5 minutes TOTAL, with NO software to download/install, my calendar and contacts were on my phone. Done. No hassle. I love it! That's how technology should work!And, for the rest - I find it intuitive to use, nice and small, and it's fun to have the camera. That was all gravy but it's good gravy!"
"a31","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","my 3rd phone and i find it to be the best of them all...it has a large screen, the key pad isnt as bad as its being protrayed on here...im a large guy, and i can work the keys fine, the camera is a little scratchy but hey, it takes pictures, what do u want? it has some awesome ring tones, you can hear very clearly on it, it looks awesome, but it scratches way too easily.  It has some great games and this is ajust a really cool phone.  Anyone can use it and everyone should own it..."
"a32","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Had an old Nokia Digital phone with ATTWS for about the last 3 years and it wasn't working to well anymore.  After being a customer wiht ATT for about 6 years I figured it should be no problem to get a new phone.  Not so.Apparently if you buy an ATT cell phone and you don't buy directly from ATT, ATT doesn't stand behind it.If you are a new customer, ATT will give you a great price on a new phone.  If you are an exisiting customer they charge you up to 3x as much for the same phone.  In addition it did not appear to be possible to buy this phone from the ATT website as an existing customer.Ended up paying over $200.00 for this phone from ATT.  We'll it is a great phone but not as intuitive as past Nokias.  Color screen is nice, tons of features, but as noted the screen is tough to see in the sunlight.Don't hesitate to buy this phone, just don't buy it from ATT."
"a33","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","I've had my t616 for about 5 days now, and am impressed by the quality, the clarity and features.The camera leaves a lot to be desired, but the call quality is wonderful. I got it in part to other reviews I read and the availability of accessories for it.I beamed over contacts from my pocket pc and palm os devices with minimum hassle, as well as being able to send and receive contacts from other bluetooth/infrared phone users."
"a34","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This phone is an excellent phone.  It has a very good color screen, it is well disigned, the camera is pretty good for a phone, and it has numerous features.  For example, if you have a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC with an IR sensor, you can transfer phone numbers, to-do items, and more.  You can aslo record soound, apply themes to you background, and surf the web.  The phone has a very nicely layed out case and menu thats easy to navigate.  It also has a very quality feel when you hold it in you hand.  The only very minor problem with this phone is that the case smuges easily.  Sony includes a nice cloth to wipe it down with.  Besides that, this phone is incredibele.  I got two of them under a family plan with att and have not been dissapointed.  The price is ok, so I would give this phone a 5 out of 5."
"a35","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This phone is loaded with bells and whistles. This is one of the best phones that i have ever owned. The battery life is excellent, I charge the phone about every 3 days(usually waits until the bar is empty befor recharging) the talk time is great. Very small lightweight. I have MMode with att and i also use my phone with my laptop to access the internet at times when i am not in a hotspot. The IR on this phone works great and barely needs line of sight to make it work w/pc. Software was provided w/phone and it is very easy to sync outlook and contacts. voice support is really great also. I purchased this phone for $49 from ATT store, price was originally $199, but i printed out ad from Att website and took to the Att store and they matched the price...What a steal!"
"a36","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Upgrading from the simplistic Nokia phone to the more complex Sony Erricson was the best thing that I ever experienced...phone wise. This phone has many features, some take a bit getting used to, but once mastered this phone can be a powerful tool that nobody will know what they did without it. Bluetooth, one of my favorite features connect right up to my Apple iBook through a Bluetooth USB adapter. Surfing the net from anywhere while my phone is in my pocket is great. Poly-phonic rings tones are sweet! Pictures do need significant lighting, but can be great fun. Actually talking on this phone let my ears expierence clear calls from friends and family, even better quality with the included headset. The two not so major con's are a small lack of processor speed, and picture memory which again is again fixable by sending pictures to my laptop via bluetooth. But overall this dense, however not heavy phone is a great companion to one's day to day activities."
"a37","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","Sony's products are known for being very stylish, and this phone is no exception.  Everything about it is organized, compact,and very very sleek.  The menus are logical, however they take a little getting used to, but overall is very good.  One thing that I like in particular is that you dont have to worry about random little things- for example if you're trying to store a number and get a call, it will handle the call, and once you hang up everything you were doing i the contact book will still be there and ready to go.  Anyway, overall it is a great phone.  The only problem I've experienced i the 5 months I've had it is that the joystick became slightly stuck in the past.  It's not much of an issue, but somewhat annoying (although I've read that you can purchase a cheap replacement part if it's really an issue.)  Overall, an excellent little piece of technology."
"a38","2020-01-20T07:15:56.522Z","C00","Hi, I am a representative of OUBank. How big of a mortgage were you thinking of?","This is a good phone, not the greatest I've ever had but the service is good in Oklahoma and Texas. I've only had problems becasue I dropped the phone one too many times beyond that its a great phone. The camera on the phone does exactly what it needs to its a camera phone not a digital camera. The bluetooth in it is great with Macs and Pocket PC's enabled with bluetooth. The phones features can not be beat."
